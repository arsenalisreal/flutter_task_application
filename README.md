Application Details
- The application holds the task details which can be created, updated, or deleted from the application
- The application allows the user to delete or edit the task with a single click making it quite user-friendly
- A scroll bar is included to navigate across all the tasks
- All the details are stored in back4App using APIs that are generated from it


LISTING PAGE
- This page utilizes the GET API to fetch the data from back4App
- If the page does not have any data the page will by default display “no data available to display”
- Scrolling is allowed to navigate the lower entries
- It has a pop-up button overlayed at the bottom which will navigate to task adding page
- Edit and delete operations will allow you to perform desired actions on the task
- All the tasks are numbered to make it easier to take care of the numbers that are dynamically  assigned.
